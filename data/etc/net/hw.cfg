# Hardware configuration for OCNet


# Basic example of hardcoding the component address:
# no need to specify driver here, but does make things easier

# class modem {
#   hardware xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx;
# }

# Likely config for single-modem systems. We don't care about the address
# but we need to ensure the underlying component is a modem

# class modem auto;

# Setting up the loopback device, we don't need to worry about any of this

# class loop auto;

# Maybe we have a Linked Card we want to setup with a different name

# class tunnel auto tap2;

# This is valid syntax, but the options block will be ignored

# class modem auto {
#   hardware mac-here;
#   name eth2;
# }

class modem auto;

class loop auto;
